Wpull is designed to be (almost) a drop-in replacement for Wget with
minimal changes to options. It is designed to run on much larger crawls
rather than speedily downloading a single file.

Wpull's behavior is not an exact duplicate of Wget's behavior. As such,
you should not expect exact output and operation out of Wpull. However,
it aims to be a very useful alternative as its source code can be
easily modified to fix, change, or extend its behaviors.
