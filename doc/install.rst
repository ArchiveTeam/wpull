Automatic Install
=================

Once you have installed Python, lxml, and pip, install Wpull with
dependencies automatically from PyPI::

    pip3 install wpull

.. Tip:: Adding the ``--upgrade`` option will upgrade Wpull to the latest
   release. Use ``--no-dependencies`` to only upgrade Wpull.
   
   Adding the ``--user`` option will install Wpull into your home
   directory.

Automatic install is usually the best option. However, there may be
outstanding fixes to bugs that are not yet released to PyPI. In this
case, use the manual install.


Manual Install
==============

Install the dependencies known to work with Wpull::

    pip3 install -r https://raw2.github.com/chfoo/wpull/master/requirements.txt

Install Wpull from GitHub::

    pip3 install git+https://github.com/chfoo/wpull.git#egg=wpull

.. Tip:: Using ``git+https://github.com/chfoo/wpull.git@develop#egg=wpull``
   as the path will install Wpull's develop branch.


psutil

psutil is required for the disk and memory monitoring options but may not be available. To install::
