Unreleased
==========



2.0 (2016-06-17)
================

* Removed: Lua scripting support and its Python counterpart (``--lua-script`` and ``--python-script``).
* Removed: Python 3.2 & 3.3 support.
* Removed: PyPy support.
* Changed: IP addresses are normalized to a standard notation to avoid fetching duplicates such as IPv4 addresses written in hexadecimal or long-hand IPv6 addresses.
* Changed: Scripting is now done using plugin interface via ``--plugin-script``.
* Fixed: Support for Python 3.5.
* Fixed: FTP unable to handle directory listing with date in MMM DD YYYY and filename containing YYYY-MM-DD text.
* Fixed: Downloads through the proxy (such as PhantomJS) now show up in the database and can be controlled through scripting.
* Fixed: `NotFound` error when converting links in CSS file that contain URLs that were not fetched.
* Fixed: When resuming a forcefully interrupted crawl (e.g., a crash) using a database, URLs in progress were not restarted because they were not reset in the database when the program started up.


Backwards incompatibility
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This release contains backwards incompatible changes to the database
schema and scripting interface.

If you use ``--database``, the database created by older versions in
Wpull cannot be used in this version.

Scripting hook code will need to be rewritten to use the new API. See
the new documentation for scripting for the new style of interfacing
with Wpull.

Additionally for scripts, the internal event loop has switched from
Trollius to built-in Asyncio.


1.2.3 (2016-02-03)
==================

* Removed: cx_freeze build support.
* Deprecated: Lua Scripting support will be removed in next release.
* Deprecated: Python 3.2 & 3.3 support will be removed in the next release.
* Deprecated: PyPy support will be removed in the next release.
* Fixed: Error when logging in with FTP to servers that don't need a password.
* Fixed: ValueError when downloading URLs that contain unencoded unprintable characters like Zero Width Non-Joiner or Right to Left Mark.


1.2.2 (2015-10-21)
==================

* Fixed: ``--output-document`` file doesn't contain content.
* Fixed: OverflowError when URL contains invalid port number greater than 65535 or less than 0.
* Fixed: AssertionError when saving IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses to WARC files.
* Fixed: AttributeError when running with installed Trollius 2.0.
* Changed: The setup file no longer requires optional psutil.


1.2.1 (2015-05-15)
==================

* Fixed: OverflowError with URLs with large port numbers.
* Fixed: TypeError when using standard input as input file (``--input-file -``).
* Changed: using ``--youtube-dl`` respects ``--inet4-only`` and ``--no-check-certificate`` now.


1.2 (2015-04-24)
================

* Fixed: Connecting to sites with IPv4 & IPv6 support resulted in errors when IPv6 was not supported by the local network. Connections now use Happy Eyeballs Algorithm for IPv4 & IPv6 dual-stack support.
* Fixed: SQLAlchemy error with PyPy and SQLAlchemy 1.0.
* Fixed: Input URLs are not fetched in order. Regression since 1.1.
* Fixed: UnicodeEncodeError when fetching FTP files with non-ASCII filenames.
* Fixed: Session cookies not loaded when using ``--load-cookies``.
* Fixed: ``--keep-session-cookies`` was always on.
* Changed: FTP communication uses UTF-8 instead of Latin-1.
* Changed: ``--prefer-family=none`` is now default.
* Added: ``none`` as a choice to ``--prefer-family``.

* Changed: logging and progress meter to say "unspecified" instead of "none" when no content length is provided by server to match Wget.


1.1 (2015-04-03)
================

* Security: Updated certificate bundle.

* Fixed: when using ``--warc-max-size`` and ``--warc-append``, it wrote to existing sequential WARC files unnecessarily.
* Fixed: input URLs stored in memory instead of saved on disk. This issue was notable if there were many URLs provided by the ``--input-file`` option.
* Changed: when using ``--warc-max-size`` and ``--warc-append``, the next sequential WARC file is created to avoid appending to corrupt files.
* Changed: WARC file writing to use journal files and refuse to start program if any journals exist. This avoids corrupting files through naive use of ``--warc-append`` and allow for future automated recovery.
* Added: Open Graph and Twitter Card element links extraction.


1.0 (2015-03-14)
================

* Fixed: a ``--database`` path with a question mark (``?``) truncated the path, did not use a on-disk database, or causes ``TypeError``. The question mark is automatically replaced with an underscore.

0.32 (2014-04-17)
==================

* Fixes crash when HTML meta refresh URL is empty.
* Fixes crash when decoding a document that is malformed later in the document. These invalid documents are not searched for links.

* ``--span-hosts`` no longer implicitly enabled on non-recursive downloads. This behavior is superseded by strong redirect logic. (Use ``--span-hosts-allow`` to guarantee fetching of page-requisites.)
* Fixes URL query strings normalized with unnecessary percent-encoding escapes. Some servers do not handle percent-encoded URLs well.
* Fixes crash handling directory paths that may contain a filename or a filename that is a directory. This crash occurs when a URL like `/blog` and `/blog/` exists. If a directory path contains a filename, the part of the directory path is suffixed with `.d`. If a filename is an existing directory, the filename is suffixed with `.f`.
* Fixes crash when URL's hostname contains characters that decompose to dots.

  * Added url.normalize() convenience function.
  * writer: safe_filename(), url_to_filename(), url_to_dir_path() were modified.


0.25 (2014-03-13)
=================

* Fixes link converter not operating on the correct files when ``.N`` files were written.
* Fixes apparent hang when Wpull is almost finished on documents with many links.

  * Previously, Wpull adds all URLs to the database causing overhead processing to be done in the database. Now, only requisite URLs are added to the database.

* Implements ``--restrict-file-names``.
* Implements ``--quota``.
* Implements ``--warc-max-size``. Like Wget, "max size" is not the maximum size of each WARC file but it is the threshold size to trigger a new file. Unlike Wget, ``request`` and ``response`` records are not split across WARC files.
* Implements ``--content-on-error``.
* Supports recording scrolling actions in WARC file when PhantomJS is enabled.
* Adds the ``wpull`` command to ``bin/``.
* Database schema change: ``filename`` column was added.

  * WebProcessor initializer now takes "parameter objects".

* Install requires new dependency: ``namedlist``.


0.24 (2014-03-09)
==================

* Fixes crash when document encoding could not be detected. Thanks to DopefishJustin for reporting.
* Fixes non-index files incorrectly saved where an extra directory was added as part of their path.
* URL path escaping is relaxed. This helps with servers that don't handle percent-encoding correctly.
* ``robots.txt`` now bypasses the filters. Use ``--no-strong-robots`` to disable this behavior.
* Redirects implicitly span hosts. Use ``--no-strong-redirects`` to disable this behavior.
* Scripting: ``should_fetch()`` info dict now contains ``reason`` as a key.


0.23.1 (2014-03-07)
===================

* Important: Fixes issue where URLs were downloaded repeatedly.


0.23 (2014-03-07)
=================

* Fixes incorrect logic in fetching robots.txt when it redirects to another URL.
* Fixes port number not included in the HTTP Host header.
* Fixes occasional ``RuntimeError`` when pressing CTRL+C.
* Fixes fetching URL paths containing dot segments. They are now resolved appropriately.
* Fixes ASCII progress bar not showing 100% when finished download occasionally.
* Fixes crash and improves handling of unusual document encodings and settings.
* Improves handling of links with newlines and whitespace intermixed.
* Requires beautifulsoup4 as a dependency.
* API:

  * ``util.detect_encoding()`` arguments modified to accept only a single fallback and to accept ``is_html``.
  * ``document.get_encoding()`` accepts ``is_html`` and ``peek`` arguments.


0.22.5 (2014-03-05)
===================

* The 'Refresh' HTTP header is now scraped for URLs.
* When an error occurs during writing WARC files, the WARC file is truncated back to the last good state before crashing.
* Works around error "Reached maximum read buffer size" downloading on fast connections. Side effect is intensive CPU usage.


0.22.4 (2014-03-05)
===================

* Fixes occasional error on chunked transfer encoding. Thanks to ivan for reporting.
* Fixes handling links with newlines found in HTML pages. Newlines are now stripped in links when scraping pages to better handle HTML soup.

===================

* Fixes another case of ``AssertionError`` on ``url_item.is_processed`` when robots.txt was enabled.
* Fixes crash if a malformed gzip response was received.
* Fixes ``--span-hosts`` to be implicitly enabled (as with ``--no-robots``) if ``--recursive`` is not supplied. This behavior unconditionally allows downloading a single file without specifying any options. It is what a user intuitively expects.


0.22.2 (2014-03-01)
===================

* Improves performance on database operations. CPU usage should be less intensive.
