* ``--span-hosts`` no longer implicitly enabled on non-recursive downloads. This behavior is superseded by strong redirect logic. (Use ``--span-hosts-allow`` to guarantee fetching of page-requisites.)
* Fixes URL query strings normalized with unnecessary percent-encoding escapes. Some servers do not handle percent-encoded URLs well.
* Fixes crash handling directory paths that may contain a filename or a filename that is a directory. This crash occurs when a URL like `/blog` and `/blog/` exists. If a directory path contains a filename, the part of the directory path is suffixed with `.d`. If a filename is an existing directory, the filename is suffixed with `.f`.
* Fixes crash when URL's hostname contains characters that decompose to dots.

=================

* Fixes link converter not operating on the correct files when ``.N`` files were written.
* Fixes apparent hang when Wpull is almost finished on documents with many links.

  * Previously, Wpull adds all URLs to the database causing overhead processing to be done in the database. Now, only requisite URLs are added to the database.

* Implements ``--restrict-file-names``.
* Implements ``--quota``.
* Implements ``--warc-max-size``. Like Wget, "max size" is not the maximum size of each WARC file but it is the threshold size to trigger a new file. Unlike Wget, ``request`` and ``response`` records are not split across WARC files.
* Implements ``--content-on-error``.
* Supports recording scrolling actions in WARC file when PhantomJS is enabled.

  * WebProcessor initializer now takes "parameter objects".

* Install requires new dependency: ``namedlist``.


0.24 (2014-03-09)
==================

* Fixes crash when document encoding could not be detected. Thanks to DopefishJustin for reporting.
* Fixes non-index files incorrectly saved where an extra directory was added as part of their path.
* URL path escaping is relaxed. This helps with servers that don't handle percent-encoding correctly.

=================

* Fixes incorrect logic in fetching robots.txt when it redirects to another URL.
* Fixes port number not included in the HTTP Host header.

* Improves handling of links with newlines and whitespace intermixed.
* Requires beautifulsoup4 as a dependency.

===================

* Fixes occasional error on chunked transfer encoding. Thanks to ivan for reporting.

===================

* Fixes another case of ``AssertionError`` on ``url_item.is_processed`` when robots.txt was enabled.
* Fixes crash if a malformed gzip response was received.
* Fixes ``--span-hosts`` to be implicitly enabled (as with ``--no-robots``) if ``--recursive`` is not supplied. This behavior unconditionally allows downloading a single file without specifying any options. It is what a user intuitively expects.


0.22.2 (2014-03-01)
===================

* Improves performance on database operations. CPU usage should be less intensive.


0.22.1 (2014-02-28)

* Improvements on reducing CPU usage consumption.
* API: Engine and Processor interaction refactored to be asynchronous.

  * The Engine and Processor classes were modified significantly.

===================

* NameValueRecord now supports a ``normalize_override`` argument to how specific keys are cased instead of the default title-case.
* Fixes WARC file's field names to match the same cases as hanzo's warc-tools. warc-tools does not support case-insensitivity as required by the WARC specification in section 4. The WARC files generated by Wpull are conformant however.
