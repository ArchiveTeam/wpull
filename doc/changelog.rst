Unreleased
==========

* Fixed: Plugins are now loaded early again, restoring behaviour in version 1.x and allowing plugins to override wpull components again.
* Fixed: `--concurrent` option had no effect since version 2.0.
* Fixed: wpull no longer flattens consecutive slashes in the path component of URLs, in line with RFC 3986, related standards, and behaviour of other software (wget and browsers).
* Fixed: Backslashes in URL paths are now treated like forward slashes in accordance with the URL Standard and behaviour of browsers.
* Fixed: ASCII tab and newline characters are now stripped from URLs, as required by the URL Standard.
* Fixed: Empty ports in URLs are now handled correctly, i.e. as if no colon appeared in the host.
* Added: URL prioritisation through `--priority-*` options and a `get_priority` hook.
* Added: Meta WARC splitting whenever data WARCs are split using the `--warc-split-meta` option.
* Changed: `wpull.pipeline.pipeline.ItemSource` now deals in item generation coroutines rather than items directly.
* Changed: `wpull.database.base.BaseURLTable` and its subclasses now have to take care of returning the URLs in the expected order; the two arguments to their `check_out` method have been removed.


Backwards incompatibility
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Plugins are now loaded very early in the initialisation again (as in version 1.x). This means that the various components of wpull
are not yet initialised at the time `WpullPlugin.activate()` is executed. Plugins written for versions 2.0 through 2.0.3 which use
instances directly will need to be changed to instead replace the relevant class in WpullPlugin.app_session.factory.class_map`.

Any direct usage of the `ItemSource`, `Worker`, or `Producer` classes in `wpull.pipeline.pipeline` has to be adapted to handle item
generation coroutines instead of items. The `Pipeline` and `PipelineSeries` classes in the same module are not affected.

The `*URLTable.check_out` method no longer receives status and level filter arguments. It is now the URLTable's duty to return URLs
in the correct order. For the default implementation, this means first sorted by highest priority, then todos before errors.


2.0.3 (2017-05-15)
==================

* Removed: HTTP CONNECT support
* Fixed: `ValueError` crash from URL parsing

Note: This version was only available on the fork by falconkirtaran until 2018-10-10.


2.0.2 (2017-01-12)
==================

* Fixed: Deadlock when wpull is finished.
* Fixed: `AttributeError` crash on some SSL connections.
* Fixed: `--warc-max-size` option had no effect since version 2.0.
* Fixed: `AttributeError` crash from asyncio reading from a closed connection.

Note: This version was only available on the fork by falconkirtaran until 2018-10-10.


2.0.1 (2016-06-21)
==================

* Fixed: `KeyError` crash when psutil was not installed.
* Fixed: `AttributeError` proxy error using PhantomJS due to response body not written to a file.


2.0 (2016-06-17)
================

* Removed: Lua scripting support and its Python counterpart (``--lua-script`` and ``--python-script``).
* Removed: Python 3.2 & 3.3 support.
* Removed: PyPy support.
* Changed: IP addresses are normalized to a standard notation to avoid fetching duplicates such as IPv4 addresses written in hexadecimal or long-hand IPv6 addresses.
* Changed: Scripting is now done using plugin interface via ``--plugin-script``.
* Fixed: Support for Python 3.5.
* Fixed: FTP unable to handle directory listing with date in MMM DD YYYY and filename containing YYYY-MM-DD text.
* Fixed: Downloads through the proxy (such as PhantomJS) now show up in the database and can be controlled through scripting.
* Fixed: `NotFound` error when converting links in CSS file that contain URLs that were not fetched.
* Fixed: When resuming a forcefully interrupted crawl (e.g., a crash) using a database, URLs in progress were not restarted because they were not reset in the database when the program started up.


Backwards incompatibility
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

This release contains backwards incompatible changes to the database
schema and scripting interface.

If you use ``--database``, the database created by older versions in
Wpull cannot be used in this version.

Scripting hook code will need to be rewritten to use the new API. See
the new documentation for scripting for the new style of interfacing
with Wpull.

Additionally for scripts, the internal event loop has switched from
Trollius to built-in Asyncio.


1.2.3 (2016-02-03)
==================

* Removed: cx_freeze build support.
* Deprecated: Lua Scripting support will be removed in next release.

1.2.2 (2015-10-21)
==================

* Fixed: ``--output-document`` file doesn't contain content.
* Fixed: OverflowError when URL contains invalid port number greater than 65535 or less than 0.

1.2.1 (2015-05-15)
==================

* Fixed: OverflowError with URLs with large port numbers.
* Fixed: TypeError when using standard input as input file (``--input-file -``).
* Changed: using ``--youtube-dl`` respects ``--inet4-only`` and ``--no-check-certificate`` now.


1.2 (2015-04-24)
================

* Fixed: Connecting to sites with IPv4 & IPv6 support resulted in errors when IPv6 was not supported by the local network. Connections now use Happy Eyeballs Algorithm for IPv4 & IPv6 dual-stack support.
* Fixed: SQLAlchemy error with PyPy and SQLAlchemy 1.0.
* Fixed: Input URLs are not fetched in order. Regression since 1.1.
* Fixed: UnicodeEncodeError when fetching FTP files with non-ASCII filenames.
* Fixed: Session cookies not loaded when using ``--load-cookies``.
* Fixed: ``--keep-session-cookies`` was always on.
* Changed: FTP communication uses UTF-8 instead of Latin-1.

* Changed: logging and progress meter to say "unspecified" instead of "none" when no content length is provided by server to match Wget.


1.1 (2015-04-03)
================

* Security: Updated certificate bundle.

* Fixed: when using ``--warc-max-size`` and ``--warc-append``, it wrote to existing sequential WARC files unnecessarily.
* Fixed: input URLs stored in memory instead of saved on disk. This issue was notable if there were many URLs provided by the ``--input-file`` option.
* Changed: when using ``--warc-max-size`` and ``--warc-append``, the next sequential WARC file is created to avoid appending to corrupt files.
* Changed: WARC file writing to use journal files and refuse to start program if any journals exist. This avoids corrupting files through naive use of ``--warc-append`` and allow for future automated recovery.
* Added: Open Graph and Twitter Card element links extraction.


1.0 (2015-03-14)
================

* Fixed: a ``--database`` path with a question mark (``?``) truncated the path, did not use a on-disk database, or causes ``TypeError``. The question mark is automatically replaced with an underscore.

=================

* Fixes link converter not operating on the correct files when ``.N`` files were written.
* Fixes apparent hang when Wpull is almost finished on documents with many links.
